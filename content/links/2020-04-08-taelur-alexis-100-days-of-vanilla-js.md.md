  Losing the framework or library specific demos, Tae'lur Alexis takes a look at
  the fundamentals of JavaScript, teaching the building blocks that everyone
  would benefit from knowing. I find it amazing that people are putting
  resources like this into the community, especially with JavaScript which is
  always constantly evolving. I personally am really excited to follow this
  series as it comes out over the next year or so, I would recommend you follow
  along too even if you think you are already solid on the JS front (if even
  just to see what other themes come along after Sailor Moon!)
