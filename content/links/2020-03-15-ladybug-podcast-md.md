  This is a podcast by Emma Bostian, Kelly Vaughn and Ali Spittel - one that I
  have been listening to religiously over the past six months or so and have
  loved every episode. With a whole bunch of episodes across a range of subject
  matters, ranging from technical to other career and personal elements, if you
  haven't listened to it yet jump into the back catalogue now.
