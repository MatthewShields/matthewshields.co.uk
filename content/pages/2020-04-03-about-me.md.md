    title: My career so far
    text: >-
      After graduating from Leeds College of Art in 2012 specialising in Graphic
      Design, I quickly started at Stickyeyes as a Junior Designer. A year or so
      after with a growing love for coding (teaching myself in my spare time), I
      moved over to the development side of the team. Eight years later and I am
      still at Stickyeyes having worked my way through to Lead Developer now
      managing the development team.


      I have worked at every level of our development team and love bringing
      this range of experience to help guide my team of developers and testers.
      This helps us when working across a huge range of creative and technical
      projects with the wider Design and Development team.

    title: My skillsets
    text: >-
      One of my biggest strengths as a developer has always been my ability to
      take on a challenge.


      **Creative Development** – One of my favourite things to work on is a
      creative challenge when creating PR campaigns for our clients. Whether
      that has been using the Twitter API, creating 3D globe cartograms or
      inventing interactive games I really like the variety and learning new
      skills from each of them.


      **WordPress Development** – I have used WordPress as the basis for my
      content managed builds throughout my career, and am highly skilled at
      creating bespoke highly performant, secure solutions using this platform.
      I am looking to bring my Gutenberg experience up to this level too.


      **Internal Tool Builds** – Optimising processes is something that I feel
      passionate about. Over the years when I've seen processes where I think I
      can help I have created tools and scripts to accumatively save hundreds of
      work hours letting people get back to using their expert skills on the
      next task at hand.

    title: Highlights of projects I've worked on
    text: >-
      They might be one of my favourite projects because of the results, the
      challenge of doing them or even just because they were a lot of fun!


      Agency life means that I can't always name names with a lot of the
      projects that I have worked on, however the below gets straight to the
      detail, which is the interesting part anyway.

      - title: Poker Probability Engine
        text: >-
          Possibly my favourite project I ever worked on was creating a poker
          probability engine for users to be able to calculate their probability
          of winning with any given hand. To me this is the clearest example of
          my work where it isn't immediately obvious for the user how
          sophisticated it is behind the scenes, but it brought me sheer joy
          with the hours of figuring out how to build it.


          One of the biggest challenges of this project was that it had to be
          completely client side. With no database of previous game data
          allowed, I created a mathematical system of hand comparison and
          implemented the Monte Carlo method, where using the declared cards,
          multiple games are played and tracked to give their probability. On
          top of this I was also set very ambitious speed performance targets of
          5,000 games in five seconds with a high level of accuracy.


          I managed to completely smash the performance target and built a
          system where over 10,000 games are played in under one second and a
          highly accurate probability given (even on low powered devices) via a
          highly usable interface on either mobile or desktop.

              Twitter API Integration, Custom built PHP Powered API and MySQL
              database.
        text: >-
          In order to comment on who are the 'hot picks' for the NFL Draft, me
          and my team built a tool that would track Twitter mentions and rank
          players in real time, along with analysing which team Twitter
          predicted may pick them. This required a lot of back-end analysis and
          performance optimisation, and was hugely successful.


          Although not an American Football fan, I very much enjoyed figuring
          out how to use the Twitter API to our needs and building our own
          analysis tool and performant API for use with a seperate React
          Application.

      - title: 40x40 Design – 'Dev is part of the design process'
        text: >-
          I took part in 40x40.design, a sell-out event organised by my team for
          Leeds Digital Festival; An event consisting of forty two minute talks
          by 40 designers. Or more precisely, 39 designers and 1 developer. I
          talked about how designers and developers can work together better –
          this was a hugely positive experience.
