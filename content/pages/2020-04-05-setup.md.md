      Absolutely loving the VS Code Editor for the past year or so, it is highly
      configurable, works fantastically, no more Git integration memory issues
      and fantastic eco system of extensions, though I always try to keep it
      light.


      Speaking of which, some extensions I would recommend are:


      * **Git Blame**(even though I have issues with the name)

      * **Duplicate Action**

      * **Prettier â€“ Code Formatter**

      * <a

      target="_blank">**Live Share**</a>

      * <a href="https://github.com/vsls-contrib/codetour"
      target="_blank">**Code Tour**</a> (a new addition but loving it so far)

      * **Docker Explorer**
