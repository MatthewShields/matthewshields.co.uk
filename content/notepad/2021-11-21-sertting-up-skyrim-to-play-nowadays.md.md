Skyrim is awesome, but is obviously quite an old game now. Out of the box my biggest wants were:

* Higher Frame Rates
* Higher Resolution Graphics

I've never dabbled in PC game mods before as still quite new to PC gaming on the whole but Nexusmods have made it super easy to get the above up and running.

## Step One - Install Vortex Mod Manager

Install the app from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). Easy peasy and although is optional (you can apply mods manually) it was a WHOLE bunch easier for a newb like myself.

## Step Two - Install a Mod / Higher Frame Rates

Lets go for frame rate improvements first. You will want to install [SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) and you should see the Vortex option in the download buttons.
